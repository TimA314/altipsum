    "Truth may seem but cannot be; Beauty brag but tis not she; Truth and beauty buried be. When they had sworn to this advised doom, They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence; To show her bleeding body thorough Rome, And so to publish Tarquins foul offence: Which being done with speedy diligence, The Romans plausibly did give consent To Tarquins everlasting banishment. A womans face with Natures own hand painted Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion; A womans gentle heart, but not acquainted With shifting change, as is false womens fashion; From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beautys rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory: In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, As the death-bed whereon it must expire, Consumed with that which it was nourishd by. It shall be cause of war and dire events, And set dissension twixt the son and sire; Subject and servile to all discontents, As dry combustious matter is to fire: Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy, They that love best their loves shall not enjoy",
